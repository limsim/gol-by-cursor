# Game of Life with the help of Cursor

Hi there! Let's learn about a super fun game called "The Game of Life"!

## What is it? ðŸ¤”

Imagine you have a big grid of squares, like a checkerboard. Each square can either be:
- Empty (ðŸ˜´)
- Or have a tiny creature living in it (ðŸ˜Š)

## How does it work? ðŸŽ®

The tiny creatures follow three simple rules:

1. **Lonely creatures disappear** ðŸ˜¢
   - If a creature has less than 2 friends nearby, it gets lonely and goes away

2. **Happy creatures stay** ðŸ˜Š
   - If a creature has 2 or 3 friends nearby, it's happy and stays

3. **Crowded creatures leave** ðŸ˜«
   - If a creature has more than 3 friends nearby, it gets too crowded and goes away

## The Magic Part! âœ¨

Empty squares can get new creatures too! If an empty square has exactly 3 creature neighbors, a new creature appears there - like magic! ðŸª„

## How to Watch It ðŸ‘€

1. Start with any pattern you like
2. Watch as the creatures follow these simple rules
3. See how your pattern changes and moves
4. It's like a tiny world that changes all by itself!

Isn't it amazing how such simple rules can create such fun patterns? ðŸŒˆ
