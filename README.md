## What is it? ðŸ¤”

Imagine you have a big grid of squares, like a checkerboard. Each square can either be:
- Empty (ðŸ˜´)
- Or have a tiny creature living in it (ðŸ˜Š)

## How does it work? ðŸŽ®

The tiny creatures follow three simple rules:

1. **Lonely creatures disappear** ðŸ˜¢
   - If a creature has less than 2 friends nearby, it gets lonely and goes away

2. **Happy creatures stay** ðŸ˜Š
   - If a creature has 2 or 3 friends nearby, it's happy and stays

3. **Crowded creatures leave** ðŸ˜«
   - If a creature has more than 3 friends nearby, it gets too crowded and goes away

## The Magic Part! âœ¨

Empty squares can get new creatures too! If an empty square has exactly 3 creature neighbors, a new creature appears there - like magic! ðŸª„

## How to Play ðŸŽ®

1. **Access the Game**
   - After running `npm run dev`, your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:9000`
   - If it doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to `http://localhost:9000`

2. **Game Controls**
   - **Start**: Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation
   - **Stop**: Click the "Stop" button to pause the simulation
   - **Clear**: Click the "Clear" button to reset the grid
   - **Randomize**: Click the "Randomize" button to create a random pattern

3. **Creating Patterns**
   - Click any cell on the grid to toggle it between alive (green) and dead (white)
   - You can create patterns while the simulation is running or stopped
   - Try creating some classic patterns:
     - **Blinker**: Three cells in a row
     - **Glider**: A pattern that moves diagonally across the grid
     - **Block**: Four cells in a 2x2 square

4. **Tips**
   - Start with simple patterns to understand how the rules work
   - Use the "Stop" button to pause and modify your pattern
   - Try the "Randomize" button to see how complex patterns evolve

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-of-life.git
cd game-of-life
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

For development (with hot reload):
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:9000`

For production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Future Improvements ðŸš€

Here's what we're planning to add:

- [ ] Code Quality
  - [ ] Add ESLint for code linting
  - [ ] Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
  - [ ] Implement TypeScript strict mode

- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Set up Jest testing framework
  - [ ] Add unit tests for game logic
  - [ ] Add integration tests for UI components

- [ ] CI/CD
  - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions
  - [ ] Add automated testing on push
  - [ ] Add automated deployment

- [ ] Features
  - [ ] Add preset patterns (glider, blinker, etc.)
  - [ ] Add grid size controls
  - [ ] Add simulation speed control
  - [ ] Add pattern saving/loading

Feel free to contribute to any of these improvements!
